* For report formatting, we will use the 2017 CVPR conference style
  files that have been provided here.

* Please read the project description file: project-f17.pdf for page
  limit requirements of all project reports and what information to
  include in each report.

* The examples included in this directory and the two sub-directories
  do not conform to the page limits and other reporting requirements
  for the EC 503 project. So use them only as examples of
  writing-style and report-formatting. Also ignore any information
  about "double-blind peer reviewing" as this is for a real CVPR paper
  submission and not for the EC 503 project reports.
